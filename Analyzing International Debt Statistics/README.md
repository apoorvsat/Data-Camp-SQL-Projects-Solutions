# Introduction 
In this project, international debt data collected by The World Bank will be analyzed. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. The answers to the following questions will be sought:
* What is the number of distinct countries present in the database?
* What country has the highest amount of debt?
* What country has the lowest amount of repayments?
