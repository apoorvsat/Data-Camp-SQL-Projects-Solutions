## 🧾 Abstract
As the gaming market is set to exceed $300 billion by 2027, major publishers are racing to create the next big hit. This project looks at video games by analyzing critic and user scores, and sales data for the top 400 games from 1977 to today. By studying these elements, we aim to find patterns that highlight the best times in gaming and understand how the industry has changed. Using methods like data joining, set theory comparisons, filtering, grouping, and ordering, this analysis reveals trends and factors that lead to a game's success. While this project focuses on 400 games, a larger dataset with over 13,000 games on Kaggle provides more opportunities for deeper research.


The solution and analysis is available in the [Solution](Solution.md) file.

You may access the dataset provided in the [Data](Data) file to practice on your own.
