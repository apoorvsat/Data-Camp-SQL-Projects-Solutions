## 🧾 Abstract
Exploring the significant role of product carbon footprints (PCFs) in global emissions, this project delves into the intricate factors of heat generation during manufacturing and transportation. With over 75% of global emissions attributed to products ranging from food to appliances, understanding PCFs becomes paramount. Leveraging publicly available data on nature.com, this analysis focuses on PCFs provided by various companies, quantifying greenhouse gas emissions associated with individual products in terms of CO2 equivalents. 

The solution and analysis is available in the [Solution](Solution.md) file.
